# TT-PHP-Yaml-Reader
A PHP file that reads a YAML file corresponding to a particular toon and gives some info on the corresponding toon.

This is a work in progress, and honestly I'm sharing it just because. I've used it with multiple .YAML files from  a Toontown Offline server. Not sure if it'll work with other servers.

# To-Do
Make the output prettier, add more info, perhaps even display a picture of the toon
Also have it able to search among multiple .yaml files for a certain toon and display that toon's info
Make it possible to edit the toon via an online GUI interface

# Why?
I'm bored.
